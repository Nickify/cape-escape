        <dt>Q: Why should I use this app?</dt>
        <dd>A: Heroes are faster, safer, and more reliable than police and uber drivers. In recent times, their numbers have grown significantly, reaching a scale that makes it finally possible to harness them for mass transportation at an affordable cost.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do you recruit the heroes? How can I know that my hero is trustworthy?</dt>
        <dd>A: We recruit via LinkedIn! Our vetting process is a rigorous one and involves multiple rounds of mock interviews. Nobody wants a villain!</dd>
        <dt>Q: How do I request a hero?</dt>
        <dd>A: Simply download our app, then tap a button to begin. Your hero will arrive shortly.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How much does it cost?</dt>
        <dd>A: Since Cape Escape is a marketplace for transportation, the price you pay is based on factors such as distance and availability of heroes. You set the maximum price you’re willing to pay for a given hero and then Cape Escape matches you with a hero that’s willing to accept your price.</dd>
        <dt>Q: How does it work?</dt>
        <dd>A: Our product is powered by a complex algorithm which efficiently matches idle heroes with users based on factors such as proximity and shortest time-to-destination. The system is built on a serverless architecture, which makes running and scaling our backend services simple and cost-effective, allowing us to reliably serve the needs of Cape Escape's ever growing user base.</dd>
        <dt>Q: What if I have a complaint about my hero?</dt>
        <dd>A: Cape Escape is a customer obsessed company. We value each customer and want to ensure a positive experience. Therefore, we’ve staffed our customer service team with serverless chatbots that are available 24/7 to assist you.</dd>

        <dt>Q: How many people can my hero assist?</dt>
