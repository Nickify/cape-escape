      Cape Escape has a top-notch team dedicated to recruiting, training, and equipping our heroes. We go through a very rigorous process to ensure you have the best of the best when you need help the most.
    </p>

    <p class="content">
      Every hero goes through a thorough hiring process where we perform background checks, evaluate their various proficiencies, and conduct several rounds of mock interviews. Heroes that are accepted into Cape Escape are given access to all sorts of amenities. We provide our employees with health care, time off, and access to our R&D lab. Heroes are their most heroic when they are well-equipped, welll-prepared, and well-fed.

            Miao-Man has been with Cape Escape since its inception. He is a founding member and has saved countless people in his time with us. He is known for his X-Ray vision which allows him to see through walls and poorly constructed arguments. Despite this though, he still requires corrective lenses.

          <p class="content">
            Zaytrix is the newest member of Cape Escape, but don't let his bright-eyed and bushy-tailed demeanor fool you. Considered a late bloomer by some, Zaytrix only recently discovered his powers and came into his own. Almost overnight he went from being unable to predict the weather the next day to suddenly being 2 steps of ahead of bad guys and their nefarious ways.

            Master-Mike is the mastermind behind our cohort of heroes. He is the brains of the operation and uses his supreme genius to allow Cape Escape to always be ahead of the curve. His incredible widom does come with some drawbacks though. No matter what sort of insight that brain of his might give him, it doesn't justify putting pineapple on pizza.
